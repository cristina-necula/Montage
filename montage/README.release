1. DOWNLOADING MONTAGE


Download as a gzipped tar file (15 MB) from the GitHub page at

    https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/Montage

or clone the GitHub repository in your desktop (if you have a compatible Platform and OS). Click the "Clone in Desktop" button,

The latest version of the Montage code can also be be found at:

    http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/download.html

Montage can be downloaded as a gzipped tar file (Montage_vX.Y.tar.gz), or
as individual components.  


2. LICENSE

Montage is released under a BSD 3-clause license. See the LICENSE file with this distribution.

Please contact the Montage Help Desk at

   http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/Helpdesk/nph-genTicketForm?projname=Montage&projmail=montage@ipac.caltech.edu

if you have any questions about the terms of use.


3. INSTALLING MONTAGE

   i. You will need a gcc compiler. Many systems now come with such a compiler already loaded, but Mac OS 10.X 
      platforms are the most notable exception. You can download Apple's Xcode integrated development environment from 
      https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ (Apple developer account needed; free), or you can download command line tools, 
      including a gcc compiler, from the Xcode downloads page at https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action. 
      Before doing any installations or upgrades, however, we recommend you consult with your System Administrator.

      To check that you have a gcc compiler installed, go to the command line and type "gcc." If you have a complier 
      installed, you will get a message that looks like: "i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2: no input files." If you do not 
      have a compiler installed, you will get a "Command not found message."


  ii. Unpack the gzipped tar file:

         gunzip Montage_vX.Y.tar.gz
         tar xvf Montage_vX.Y.tar
     
      This will create the directory Montage_vX.Y, which contains all the
      necessary files to build Montage.    

 iii. Go into the Montage directory:

          cd Montage_vX.Y  (though presumably if you are reading
                            this file you are already in the
                            right directory)

  iv. Type the following:

          make

      This will configure and build Montage on your system. The process may take several minutes, and will build all the 
      libraries and executables, and place all the executables in $INSTALL/Montage_vX.Y/bin. Nothing outside the Montage 
      directory will be altered. The build may take up to several minutes, and you will see a a continuous stream of 
      output messages during this process.

  v.  If you want to be able to run the Montage executables from any directory, you will need to add 
      $INSTALL/Montage_vX.Y/bin to your path.

      For instance, using the bash shell on Linux, after installing Montage in /home/username/Montage_vX.Y, we add 
      the following line to /home/username/.bash-profile:

         PATH=$PATH:$HOME/Montage_vX.Y/bin

      If you are using csh, you would add the following line to /home/username/.cshrc:

         set path = ($path /home/username/Montage_vX.Y/bin)


4. GETTING STARTED

Montage is a toolkit rather than an application. You may run the  tools from the command line, or embed them in scripts or 
programs. The best way to get started and understand the steps in creating a mosaic is is to follow the steps to create a 
2MASS mosaic of M101 in the Tutorial at  http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/m101tutorial.html.

To see how to call the tools in scripts, see the user-contributed scripts at 

   http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/contributed_software.html
   
One script creates a 3-color Digital Sky Survey (DSS) mosaics of the Pleiades, and another makes mosaics and a full-color 
JPEG of a region of the sky wth images from 2MASS, DSS and SDSS. You are free to download use and modify these scripts. 
Please acknowledge the contributor in any publications that result.
