<h1> Montage Viewer:  Miscellaneous Directives</h1>

There are couple of additional mViewer directives that can be useful under unusual circumstances:</p>

<ul>
   <li> <b>-nowcs</b> The FITS file has no WCS information, which means we cannot perform
        any coordinate-base operations.  Nevertheless we still wish to generate a PNG/JPEG
        of the data array.</li>

   <li> <b>-noflip</b> mViewer analyzes parameters like CDELT and CROTA and flips axes to
        put North as close to up and East as close to left as is possible without real rotation.
        Sometimes we want to override this logic.</li>
</ul>
