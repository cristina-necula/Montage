<div style="width: 500px;">
<p>The mViewer documentation pages contain command examples for most of the program's 
capabilites.</p>

<p><a href="http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/mViewer/data">Here</a> you can find image and table files that can be
used to test out those commands.</p>

<p>In addition, we have a few worked examples to further illustrate how to achieve certain
effects:</p>

<ul>
   <li> <a href="mViewer_cookbookStretches.html"><b>Stretches</b></a> There are a lot of options
        when it comes to stretching the data.  This page describes the available stretches and 
        some of the rationale that goes into choosing the right one for the data.</li>

   <li> <a href="mViewer_cookbookSymbols.html"><b>Symbols</b></a>  Symbols in mViewer are 
        actually accurately-drawn geometries on the sky.  They can be used to give very 
        detailed information on regions or catalog data.</li>
