<h1> Montage Viewer:  Other Montage Modules</h1>

Of course, all of the other Montage modules can be of use when creating the image files that are
then sent to mViewer but there are a few that are particulary usefule with regard to presentation:</p>

<p><ul>
   <li> <b><a href="/docs/mSubimage.html">mSubimage</a>/<a href="/docs/mSubCube.html">mSubCube</a></b>
        mViewer will alway produce a PNG/JPEG of the whole image it is 
        given.  To cut out a piece for display, use these tools. This was done for most of the
        examples on these pages; the original SDSS mosaics used were twice as big in both dimensions.</p>

   <li> <b><a href="/docs/mShrink.html">mShrink</a>/<a href="/docs/mShrinkCube.html">mShrinkCube</a></b>
        Similarly, mViewer transform one pixel in the FITS files to one
        display pixel.  To changes the scale, use these tools.  mShrink can shrink (or expand) the
        scale by non-integer factors.  Alternatively, you can shrink/expand to a target size.</li>

   <li> <b><a href="/docs/mExamine.html">mExamine</a></b>
        This tool will return overall statistics on an image (<i>e.g.,</i> the
        pixel scale, center coordinates, and so on.  This is useful in deciding how to run the
        above tools and particularly useful in the Python/Web applications based on mViewer.</i>
</ul></p>
