<p>mViewer supports several data stretches.  In the following, you can click on a
command to see the results of its stretch.</p>

<p>The simplest possible stretch processes the image into 256 bins equally spaced
between the minimum and maximum data values.  For astronomical images this is 
almost always a bad idea:</p>

<p><span class="cmdstr" onclick="display('min_max_lin.png');">mViewer -ct 1 -gray fits/SDSS_r.fits min max linear -png min_max_lin.png</span></p>

<p>The reason for this is that astronomical images usually have most of their pixel
values clumped near the low end of the data range (and often all "in the noise").
The stretch can be improved by applying a non-linear stretch binned in the log
of the data value (or other functions like sqrt(), which we do not support):</p>

<p><span class="cmdstr" onclick="display('min_max_log.png');">mViewer -ct 1 -gray fits/SDSS_r.fits min max log -png min_max_log.png</span></p>

<p>Many images have extremely high dynamic range, so even log() may not be enough.
mViewer supports log(log()) and higher variants:</p>

<p><span class="cmdstr" onclick="display('min_max_loglog.png');">mViewer -ct 1 -gray fits/SDSS_r.fits min max loglog -png min_max_loglog.png</span></p>

<p>This tends to de-emphasize the low-level structure to the point where much of it
vanishes.  That may be a good thing but often is not. So mViewer allows various ways
of setting the range of the binning.  For instance, stretching from the first 
percentile in the distribution to the 99th yields:</p>

<p><span class="cmdstr" onclick="display('1_99_log.png');">mViewer -ct 1 -gray fits/SDSS_r.fits  1% 99% log -png 1_99_log.png</span></p>

<p>Of course, to get percentiles you need to generate a histogram.  For a lot of 
astronomical images this will look like a gaussian (the noise or real low-level
structure) and a very long positive tail.  It also means we can couch levels in
terms of "sigma" values:</p>

<p><span class="cmdstr" onclick="display('2s_max_log.png');">mViewer -ct 1 -gray fits/SDSS_r.fits -2s max log -png 2s_max_log.png</span></p>

<p>With the histogram we could also stretch in terms of a histogram equalization.
However, with the bulk of the distribution being noise/low-level structure, this
doesn't usually look very good.  Instead, we perform a gaussian histogram equalization
which is based on the error function (erf()) rather than the histogram itself:</p>

<p><span class="cmdstr" onclick="display('2s_max_gaussian.png');">mViewer -ct 1 -gray fits/SDSS_r.fits -2s max gaussian -png 2s_max_gaussian.png</span></p>

Again, the emphasis is often much more on the values in the long positive tail,
so we also support distorting the above with a log transform:</p>

<p><span class="cmdstr" onclick="display('2s_max_gaussianlog.png');">mViewer -ct 1 -gray fits/SDSS_r.fits -2s max gaussian-log -png 2s_max_gaussianlog.png</span></p>

<p>This last stretch is will do a creditable job on almost any image.  In fact, the
only variation that usually needs to be made is the the lower limit:  -2&sigma;
works well where the low values are real structure and higher values (up to about 
+1&sigma;) may be more appropriate the more the low-level structure is noise.</p>

<p>Also available is a sinh() stretch.  Others could easily be added.</p>

<p>The default image for this page combined a stretch with a "pseudo-color" color table:</p>

<p><span class="cmdstr" onclick="display('colorStretch.png');">mViewer -ct 4 -color ffffff -label 100p 50p "50% max gaussian" -gray fits/SDSS_r.fits 0s max gaussian -png colorStretch.png</span></p>

<p>The mViewer stretching has one more variant.  Sometimes one has a set of images
that all need to be stretched the same way.  For instance, you might have a set of
adjacent tiles that are kept as separate files rather than being coadded into one
giant (an unmanageable) single image.  You still want to display them (perhaps side
by side) as if they were part of a single whole.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you might have a collection of galaxy image that you want to view on
the same scale and with the same stretch.</p>

<p>Normally, mViewer analyzes each image separately, resulting in very different stretches.</p>

<p>To get all the images on the same stretch (especially the data-dependent gaussian histogram
equalization) we can generate a histogram (based on whatever image you wish to use as 
reference) using the Montage mHistogram module.  This uses the same algorithm as mViewer
but writes the results to a file.</p>

<p>mViewer can the be told to use this histogram file rather than generating one at run time.
This is done inside the "-gray" (and "-red", "-green", "-blue") directive using the following
construct:<p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of, <i>e.g.</i>, "-gray image.fits -2s max gaussian-log"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use "-gray image.fits -histfile ref.hist"</p>

<p>The same histogram file can thus be applied to as many images as you need.</p>
