Montage: The Astronomer's Toolkit for Building Image Mosaics and
Analyzing Image Metadata 

Montage (http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu) is an Open Source toolkit,
distributed with a BSD 3-clause license, for assembling Flexible
Image Transport System (FITS) images into mosaics, according to
the user's custom specifications of coordinates, WCS projection,
spatial sampling and rotation. The toolkit contains utilities for
reprojecting and background matching images, assembling them into
mosaics, visualizing the results, and discovering, analyzing and
understanding image metadata from archives or the user's images.
Montage is written in ANSI-C and is portable across all common *nix
platforms, including Linux, Solaris, and Mac OSX. The distribution
contains all libraries needed to build the toolkit from a single
simple "make" command, including the CFITSIO library and WCS
tools. The toolkit is in wide use in astronomy to support research
projects, and to support pipeline development, product generation and
image visualization for major projects and missions; e.g. Spitzer
Space Telescope, Herschel, Kepler, AKARI and others. Montage is
used as an exemplar application by the computer science community in
developing next-generation cyberinfrastructure, especially workflow
framework on distributed platforms.

Version 4.0 provides dedicated modules that support building and
managing mosaics of data cubes; creation of custom PNG and JPEG
images (with AVM tags) with command-line user control over the image
attributes (stretch, coordinate overlays, coordinate grids, â€¦),
and a beta version of a Python wrapper to support creation  of PNG and
JPEG images. A future release will include, e.g., support for HEALPix.

Montage was funded from 2002 to 2005 by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Earth Science Technology Office, Computation
Technologies Project, under Cooperative Agreement Number NCC5-626
between NASA and the California Institute of Technology. The Montage
distribution includes an adaptation of the MOPEX algorithm developed
at the Spitzer Science Center.  Montage is now funded by the National
Science Foundation under Award Number NSF ACI-1440620.'
