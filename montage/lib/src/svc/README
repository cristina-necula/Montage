SVC/STRUCT Library
------------------

This library allows the user to fire up external services, send
commands and receive structured messages, and parse the returned
structures.

The library can be built using using the Makefile in this directory
and "make clean" / "make".  It can be installed in standard place
(assumed to be the directory "../..") and also needs to add an 
include file to "../../include".  "make install" is currently set
to do this.o

There is a "test" subdirectory which has programs and regression 
test output (see "test/README" for details) and a "docs" subdirectory
with HTML documentation on library usage.
